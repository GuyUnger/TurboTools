my tools to make games faster in godot. optimized for myself so might not be exactly what you're looking for

script formatting:
- adds double lines between functions
- adds spaces between operators (still a bit buggy at times) and removes double spaces
- formats numbers ("0." -> "0.0", ".1" -> "0.1")
- formats comments

script generation:
- ctrl+: to open code generation tools
  - set tool script
  - turn line into seperator comment
  - more stuff but i have to use it more

scene formatting:
- automatically names root node to scene name (why can you even name these in godot)
